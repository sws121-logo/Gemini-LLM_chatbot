# Gemini LLM Q&A Application

## Overview

This project is a **Q&A Web Application** built using **Streamlit** and Google's **Gemini Pro Generative AI** model. The application allows users to ask questions through a web interface, and it leverages Google’s advanced language model (LLM) to provide detailed, real-time responses. It also keeps a session-based chat history, making the interaction feel continuous and conversational.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of the **Gemini Pro** generative model into a Streamlit-based application, providing users with a streamlined interface to interact with cutting-edge language models.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with **Google’s Gemini Pro** generative language model.
- Showcase real-time Q&A functionality powered by LLM responses.
- Enable session-based chat history to improve conversational continuity.
- Streamline the use of environment variables for secure API key management.

## Features

- **User Input Interface**: A simple and intuitive text input field for users to ask questions.
- **Real-Time Response**: Fetches answers from the **Gemini Pro** model in real-time and streams the responses back to the user.
- **Chat History**: Keeps a persistent chat history across the session, allowing users to view past questions and answers.
- **Streamlit UI**: The application utilizes Streamlit to create a clean, responsive web interface that runs locally or on the web.

## Technology Stack

### Libraries and Tools:
- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the application.
- **Streamlit**: A popular framework for creating web applications with Python.
- **Google Gemini Pro API**: A state-of-the-art large language model from Google, accessed through `google.generativeai`.
- **dotenv**: A Python library used to load environment variables from a `.env` file for secure API key management.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system.
- **Google API Key** to access the **Gemini Pro** model via `google.generativeai`.
- **Streamlit** installed via `pip`.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-qa-app.git
    cd gemini-qa-app
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API key:
    ```plaintext
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```

5. **Run the application**:
    Use Streamlit to run the app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

   The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Code Explanation

### Key Components:

1. **API Configuration**:
   The application uses `dotenv` to load environment variables securely. The API key is configured using `google.generativeai` to interact with the Gemini Pro model:
   ```python
   load_dotenv()
   genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))
   ```

2. **Gemini Pro Model**:
   A function is set up to load the **Gemini Pro** model and send user inputs to get responses:
   ```python
   model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
   chat = model.start_chat(history=[])
   
   def get_gemini_response(questions):
       response = chat.send_message(questions, stream=True)
       return response
   ```

3. **Streamlit UI**:
   - **Session State Management**: Streamlit's `session_state` is used to store and persist the chat history throughout the user session.
   - **Input and Response Handling**: The user input is captured, sent to the Gemini Pro model, and responses are streamed back in real-time.

4. **Display Chat History**:
   All interactions (both user queries and the model’s responses) are displayed below the input field for a continuous conversational experience:
   ```python
   st.subheader("The Chat History is")
   for role, text in st.session_state['chat_history']:
       st.write(f"{role}: {text}")
   ```

## Usage

1. **Ask Questions**: Enter your question in the input box labeled "Input" and click the "Ask the question" button.
2. **View Response**: The application will display the AI’s response under "The Response is".
3. **Chat History**: You can scroll through your chat history to see previous questions and answers under "The Chat History is".

## Example

After running the app, you can input any question like:
```
What is the future of AI?
```
And the app will stream back a real-time response from the **Gemini Pro** model, keeping track of the interaction in the chat history.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced User Interface**: Improve the UI/UX design for a more polished experience.
- **Multiple Language Support**: Extend the application to support input and output in multiple languages.
- **Advanced Chat Features**: Add features like chat persistence across sessions or custom user personas.
- **Error Handling**: Better manage API failures or timeouts to improve reliability.
